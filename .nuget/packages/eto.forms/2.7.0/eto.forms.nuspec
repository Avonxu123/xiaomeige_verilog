    <description>Eto.Forms is a cross platform desktop user interface framework.

This framework is built so that you can target multiple platforms with one UI codebase.

The goal of this framework is to expose a common API that can be used to build functional applications that run across platforms using their native toolkit. This will make your applications look and work as if it were a native application on all platforms.

For advanced scenarios, you can take advantage of each platform's capabilities by wrapping your common UI in a larger application, or even create your own high-level controls with a custom implementations per platform.

This framework currently supports creating Desktop applications that work across Windows Forms, WPF, MonoMac, Xamarin.Mac, and GTK#.

In order to run your Eto.Forms based application, you must also install one (or more) of the following packages:

- Eto.Platform.Wpf
- Eto.Platform.Windows
- Eto.Platform.Direct2D
- Eto.Platform.Gtk
- Eto.Platform.Gtk2
- Eto.Platform.Gtk3
- Eto.Platform.Mac64
- Eto.Platform.XamMac2
