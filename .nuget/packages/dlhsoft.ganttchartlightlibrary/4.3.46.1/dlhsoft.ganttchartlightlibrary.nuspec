    <releaseNotes>Added drag completing events on DragThumbTask (when used to support vertical drag operations, i.e. hierarchical moving), DragDependencyThumb, and DragAssignmentThumb WPF classes, allowing developers to optionally cancel the operations (or, upon dragging new dependency lines, to initialize DependencyType) in certain conditions based on their external requirments; added optional support for retrieving Schedule chart items with dependency links (predecessor items) from Gantt chart components; fixed an issue that was previously inadvertendly allowing the end user to vertically scroll the Schedule chart area up to a certain level when content was not scrollable; resolved some issues that were previously occurring when you tried to import Project XML files that didn't have a CalendarUID specified for the project; other improvements.</releaseNotes>
